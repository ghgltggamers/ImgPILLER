# IMGPILLER - An Open Source Image Editing Freely dustributed Software
ImgPILLER is an Open Source Free of cost and safe software for professional Image editing, Developed and written officially by ghgltggamer for promting out OpenSource Community and Free Software Foundation for everyone, We can not say that IMGPILLER is better than other open source image editors like GIMP because main goal is to provide a user friendly and secure & modern interface for new bies to get started, IMGPILLER is also very light weight because it directly runs from your local web browser which means you do not have to wait or a long time and just start your image editing.

## Goals
Our Goal is only 1 which is to promote aur free software foundation and OpenSource community and also for spreading the education of how an static html project can run as an professional grade software.

## Understanding the code behind the IMGPILLER
ImgPILLER uses it's custom file system (File Structuring format) for managing it self and the file system of ImgPILLER Is too simple and most commonly used widely.

### src [directory]
src is the main directory which contains the main source code of the ImgPILLER which can be modified anytime and this will impact the whole ImgPILLER software, So only modify the source code if you has good understanding of "html, css, javascript, C plus-plus" othervise you can easily harm you full software, but do not worry if you has harmed the software then you can just replace the software by simply replacing the source code.

path
```bash
/src/
```

### src/assets [directory]
assets directory is located under src directory and this directory contains all the assets file & folder which are used in ImgPILLER.

path
```bash
/src/assets/
```

### src/assets/images [directory]
images directory is located under assets directory and this directory contains all the image files for example [icons, logo, banners, native icons etc.] usually "Portable Network Graphics".

path
```bash
/src/assets/images
```

### src/css [directory]
css directory is located under the src directory and this directory contains all the style files only "Cascading Style Sheets"

path
```bash
/src/css/
```

### src/js [directory]
js directory is located under the src directory and this directory contains all the logic files and main files who are responsible for functionality of the software only "Java Script"

path
```bash
/src/js/
```

### src/native [directory]
This directory is a complex directory and what you probably should never touch if you do not know a lot about programming because this directory contains all the native source files for using web technologies as User Frontend and it self as backend. commonly "C plus-plus, bash & binaries"

path
```bash
/src/native/
```

## Files
As of now you has taken a look on every directory of this version but let's do not forgot to mention about files because they are main and responsibe for everything of ImgPILLER.


### README.md [file]

```

This file is the main startup or boot file which is the first start of the software and this file is responsible for creating projects for you.

path
```bash
/src/index.html
```


### index.js [file]
This file is responsible for index.html logic only and won't affect any other file so please if you are modifying your build do not include this file in any other html file uness you know what are you going to do.

path
```bash
/src/js/index.js
```


### main-theme.css [file]
